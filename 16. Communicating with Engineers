Communication with engineers requires clarity, precision, and relevance. Drawing on my experience at Booz Allen Hamilton, where I regularly interacted with technical teams, I would:
•	Use Visuals and Diagrams: Engineers often appreciate visual representations of data and processes, so I’d use diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate points.
•	Be Concise and Direct: Keep communication factual and to the point, focusing on logic and data.
•	Regular Feedback Loops: Implement regular feedback sessions to ensure clarity and address any misunderstandings or technical concerns promptly.
