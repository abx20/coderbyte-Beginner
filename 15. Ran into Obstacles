DIV Chiefs at DTRA -- not giving all data 
7 different divisions 
Would give data but not the whole picture -- didn't paint a picture for the whole department 
Scheduled 1 on 1 meetings with each of the DIV Chiefs 
Reviewed each program line by line -- why it was important, program managers associated with it, and more 
Built trust 
Able to get the data and implement into a dashboard -- made easier for them 
Able to see where all the programs were -- who was asssociated with that program, clients, money allocated, and more
