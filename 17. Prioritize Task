1. Prioritization
How do you prioritize tasks? I prioritize tasks based on a combination of their urgency and importance, a method informed by the Eisenhower Matrix. For instance, at Deloitte, when managing multiple supply chain assessments, I categorized tasks into:
•	Urgent and important: 
        Immediate risks to project deadlines or critical deliverables.

•	Important but not urgent: 
        Strategic tasks that affect long-term outcomes but don't require immediate action.

•	Urgent but not important:
        Tasks that need quick attention but don't significantly impact project success.

•	Neither urgent nor important: 
        Low-priority tasks that can be delegated or scheduled for later review.

  Prioritize Features 
  --Moscow Method 
      --- Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have 

      --- Allows to align with critical business goals to ensure essential features were built first
