Weaknesses

1. Patience with Process -- have strategic focus on efficiency and I can push to get 
quick results 
    ---- Beneficial but does require balancing to ensure all team is onboard 
    ---- Processes are followed through without russhing, especially with complex projects 

2. Delegating Tasks --- With my leadership background and getting put in charge, I can at times 
find it difficult to delegate tasks -- especially in high-stakes situations 
--- Through the years I have worked on trusting my team, understanding their strengths, and delegating to them 


3. Handling Ambiguity
      --- Environments where information is incomplete, goals not defined, it can be challenging 
      --- I have developed strateds to manage ambiguity --- such as 
          --- Seeking clarity
          --- Making assumptions to proceeds
          --- Adjusting plans dynamically 

  4. Technical Skills 
        --- Don't have the technology background of a lot of Google employees 
        --- I have conducted self-study, taken a Java Script 2 week bootcamp at Codesmith 
        --- Knocked out a bunch of microcredentials from Google, AWS, Microsoft to better undrestand the industry
