The critical path is the order of tasks that sets the shortest time needed to finish a project.
If any task on the critical path is delayed, the whole project gets delayed.
If the critical path changes because tasks are finished early or delays occur, the project plan needs to be adjusted.
This means shifting resources and possibly changing timelines and strategies to match the new critical path.
