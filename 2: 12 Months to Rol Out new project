For a 12-month product rollout, I would structure the process into four main phases:
1.	Initiation (Months 1-2): Conduct market research, define product requirements, and prepare a detailed project plan.
2.	Development (Months 3-6): Develop the product with iterative testing and feedback loops. During this phase, regular status meetings and updates are crucial to ensure the project remains on track.
3.	Preparation (Months 7-9): Finalize the product, prepare marketing materials, train the sales team, and set up distribution channels.
4.	Launch and Monitoring (Months 10-12): Execute the launch plan, closely monitor the market response, and adjust marketing strategies as necessary. Post-launch, gather user feedback for future improvements.
